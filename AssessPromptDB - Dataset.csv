Climate change,"Create an academic passage as part of assessment content to evaluate a student's English reading capability on the topic of 'climate change'. Make a single passage with different aspects of 'climate change' by generating both simple and complex sentences. Do not generate harmful or hateful content. Do not include any social stereotypes. After that, make 5 corresponding 'True/False' questions based on the passage. The questions should be to the point and only related to the passage topic. ","Climate change is the long-term shift in global weather patterns, mainly caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. These activities release greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the atmosphere and lead to global warming. As a result, ice sheets and glaciers are melting, causing sea levels to rise and endangering coastal communities. Additionally, extreme weather events, like hurricanes and droughts, have become more frequent and intense, putting both ecosystems and human livelihoods at risk. Despite these challenges, actions like reducing emissions, adopting renewable energy, and conserving forests can help mitigate the effects of climate change.
True/False Questions:
1. Climate change refers to temporary changes in local weather patterns.
2. Greenhouse gases contribute to global warming by trapping heat in the atmosphere.
3. Rising sea levels are caused by melting ice sheets and glaciers.
4. Hurricanes and droughts have become less frequent due to climate change.
5. Renewable energy can play a role in mitigating the effects of climate change.",True/False
